A vacation is when you take a trip to some ADJECTIVE place with your ADJECTIVE family. Usually you go to some place that is near a/an NOUN or up on a/an NOUN. A good vacation place is one where you can ride PLURAL NOUN or play GAME or go hunting for PLURAL NOUN. I like to spend my time VERB ENDING IN “ING” or VERB ENDING IN “ING”. When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three PLURAL NOUN a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers sit around VERB ENDING IN “ING”. Last summer, my little brother fell in a/an NOUN and got poison PLANT all over his PART OF THE BODY. My family is going to go to (the) A PLACE, and I will practice VERB ENDING IN “ING”. Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very ADJECTIVE and because they have to work NUMBER hours every day all year making enough PLURAL NOUN to pay for the vacation.
